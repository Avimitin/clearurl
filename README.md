# clearurl

This is a Rust implementation of the ClearURL.

## todo

* A Telegram bot
  * ~~Handle normal message~~ (**DONE**)
  * ~~Handle commands like [/addrule, /delrule, /addgroup]~~ (Not gonna support[^1])
  * Handle inline message
  * Handle channel message
* A Web frontend

[^1]: I want the bot to be silent and don't have too much functionality.
It is a clearurl bot, just do the cleaning job.
